# Hugo Demo

A demo of how to create a website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), build it with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host it.

Perhaps the only thing of interest here is the [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/build-deployment.yml) that builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
